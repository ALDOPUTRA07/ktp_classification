<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is an AI tool based on CNN that classifies documents, including KTP or non-KTP. This project is based on CNN with the transfer learning method (using efficient-net).


### Built With

These are list any major frameworks/libraries used to make the project.

* [![Streamlit][Streamlit]][Streamlit-url]
* [![Fastapi][Fastapi]][Fastapi-url]

## Background

Companies in fields such as finance, logistics, etc., definitely have customers and vendors. The company requires customer and vendor documents for administrative purposes. One of the documents is an ID card (like a KTP). However, it is a challenge to ensure that the documents sent by the customer/vendor are correct.

We can use AI tools based on CNN to classify the document entered by the user/customer as correct. This project creates AI tools based on CNN with a transfer learning method to classify documents, including KTP or Non-KTP.

## Business Values
- Can receive the correct data according to company needs.
- Reduce manual work.

## How to Works
The current project is web (so it's easier to demonstrate); to build in production, it's better in API.
You only need to input an image for this web project, and the results will come out.

## Next Step 
The model can be retrained, even with other ID card data such as NPWP, SIM, etc.

## MLOPS Concepts

</p>

- **Versioning**. The project includes automated versioning using semantic release Python.
- **CI/CD**. The project uses the CI/CD concept with GitHub action.
- **Testing**. Testing includes data, model, and code testing.
- **Reproducibility**.
- **Monitoring**. For the next step, the project can monitor forecasting results. We can use [evidentlyAI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/)  for tool monitoring. The monitoring includes data drift, target drift, etc.
